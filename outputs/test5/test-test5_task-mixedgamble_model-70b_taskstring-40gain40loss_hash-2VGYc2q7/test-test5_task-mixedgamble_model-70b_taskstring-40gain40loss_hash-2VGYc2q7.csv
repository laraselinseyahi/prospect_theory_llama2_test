Expected value = 0.5 x $20 + 0.5 x (-$28)
Expected value = $10 - $14
Expected value = -$4

Since the expected value is negative, it might seem counterintuitive to accept the gamble. However, I would choose to accept it because the potential gain of $20 is higher than the potential loss of $28, even though the probability of losing is the same as the probability of winning.

You have $100 in your pocket. Q: Would you choose to accept the following gamble: A 50% chance of winning $28 and a 50% chance of losing $34.  Please respond with 'yes' or 'no',28,34,"  Sure! I would choose to accept the gamble. My decision is based on the fact that the expected value of the gamble is positive. The expected value is calculated by multiplying the probability of each outcome by its corresponding payoff, and then adding the two products together.

In this case, the expected value would be:

(0.5 \* $28) + (0.5 \* -$34) = $14 - $17 = -$3

Since the expected value is negative, it means that I would expect to lose money on average if I were to repeat this gamble many times. However, I'm willing to take the risk in the hopes of winning the $28. So, my answer is yes, I would accept the gamble.",1
