I would choose to accept the gamble. My decision is based on the fact that the expected value of the gamble is positive.

The expected value is calculated as follows:

Expected Value = 0.5 x $22 + 0.5 x (-$26)
Expected Value = $11 - $13
Expected Value = -$2

Since the expected value is negative, it means that I would expect to lose money on average if I were to repeat this gamble many times. However, I'm willing to take the risk in the hopes of winning the $22.

So, my answer is yes, I would accept the gamble.",1
