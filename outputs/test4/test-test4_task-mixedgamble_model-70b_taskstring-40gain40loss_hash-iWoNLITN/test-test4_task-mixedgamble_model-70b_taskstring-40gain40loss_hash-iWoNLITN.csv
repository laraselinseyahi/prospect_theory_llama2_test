I would choose to rejection the gamble. The expected value of the gamble is 0, and I would rather not risk losing money.

Here's my reasoning:

* If I accept the gamble and win, I'll receive $36, which is a gain of $26 from my current $100.
* If I accept the gamble and lose, I'll lose $26, which is a loss of $26 from my current $100.

Since the probability of winning and losing is the same (50%), the expected value of the gamble is:

Expected value = 0.5 x $36 + 0.5 x (-$26) = 0

Since the expected value is 0, it means that, on average, I would neither gain nor lose money by accepting the gamble. However, I would still be risking losing $26, which I don't want to do. Therefore, I choose to reject the gamble.",0
